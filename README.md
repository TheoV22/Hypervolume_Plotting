Build on top of COCO repository : 
hyp_functions.py and main_plot.py are files that could be pushed to COCO repository to add a hypervolume visualisation option after running an experiment. 
It can help understanding the algorithm convergence to solutions as well as efficiency. 

archive_load_data.py and archive_exceptions.py are copied-pasted from their repository (re-use some of their code).
Experiments.ipynb simulate a use-case and can be run interactively : installing everything, running an experiment based on COCO test-suite, plotting hypervolume.
